        Los Angeles  is the most populous city in California; the second most populous city in the United States, after New York City; and the third-most populous city in North America, after Mexico City and New York City.
        The city is known for its Mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, Hollywood, the entertainment industry, and its sprawling metropolis.
        Los Angeles lies in a basin in Southern California, adjacent to the Pacific Ocean, with mountains as high as 10,000 feet (3,000 m), and deserts.
        Historically home to the Chumash and Tongva, Los Angeles was claimed by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. 
        The city was officially founded on September 4, 1781, by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve. 
        It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. 
        In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and thus became part of the United States. 
        Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. 
        The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California.
        Los Angeles has a diverse economy and hosts businesses in a broad range of professional and cultural fields. 
        It also has the busiest container port in the entire Americas. 
        A global city, it has been ranked 6th in the Global Cities Index and 9th in the Global Economic Power Index. 
        The Los Angeles metropolitan area also has a gross metropolitan product of $1.0 trillion (as of 2017), making it the third-largest city by GDP in the world, after the Tokyo and New York City metropolitan areas.
